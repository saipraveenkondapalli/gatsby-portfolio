        I am a recent graduate with a bachelor's degree in technology. I was a
        member of the press club at college where I primarily focused on
        gathering and writing news articles. I have a passion for building
        experiences that help others, I have applied my skills in react, python,
        SQL, No SQL, MongoDB, AWS-cloud among other skills to various projects
        at college, in Internship at EduSkills foundation and in my freelance
        work at Inherit Cloud. <br />

        I have experience in working with diverse teams with people from across
        the world. In 2021, I participated in the Global Entrepreneurship
        Exchange program, a leading workshop on entrepreneurship at Manning
        School of business, USA. I collaborated with people and won the business
        pitch competition in the first place. In 2022, I formed my own team and
        guided them which ultimately led to the team winning the competition in
        the first place.
        <br />I am looking for entry level roles in the tech industry
        with opportunities to learn skills and grow in the sector
